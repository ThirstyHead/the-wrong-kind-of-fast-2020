            Here's another way to look at the results. This time, we look at the response time of an individual request in milliseconds. This time, shorter bars are better. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice the longest bar on the graph? The green one? Yeah, that's React in dev mode again. The second longest bar on the graph? That's React in prod mode, with a response time of 150 milliseconds. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Raw JavaScript is twice as fast, at 70 milliseconds per response. Static HTML is 5 times as fast, with a 30 millisecond response time.
