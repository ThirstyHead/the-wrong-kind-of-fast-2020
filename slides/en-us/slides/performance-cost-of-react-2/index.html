            To test the cost of React, the author created a simple app that builds an HTML table with 100 rows of employee data from a simple JSON file. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to React, he chose a couple of different popular templating libraries -- Nunjucks and Pug. (Pug used to be called Jade.)
            </p>

            <p>The author also included an example using raw JavaScript (ES6, or ECMAScript 6). Best of all, he gave us a static HTML and CSS baseline so that we can see the true cost of all of these different templating solutions. </p>
