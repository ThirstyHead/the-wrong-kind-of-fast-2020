            A performance budget has measurable outcomes, and targets or goals to achieve. 
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, I suggest to every new client that they start with a goal to keep their page weight under 1 mb (including all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, etc.), and their time-to-interactive (the time it takes for the web app to be actually usable) to be under 3 seconds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Where did I come up with these numbers?
